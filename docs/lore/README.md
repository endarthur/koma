# Koma Terminal - Lore & World Building

Welcome to the narrative side of Koma! This directory explores the story, mythology, and world behind the terminal.

## 🌌 The Story

Koma Workstation is a piece of **retrospec technology** - technology that could have existed in 1984-1987, should have existed, but didn't. Until now.

**The Fiction:** Craton Systems, founded by geologists who wanted their own Unix workstation, created the Koma Workstation line. Powered by the Olivine kernel, featuring Spinifex graphics, running the Koma Shell, and distributing tools via Provenance package manager.

**The Reality:** We're building that system now, in 2025, using the retrospec engineering philosophy: respecting historical constraints while applying modern knowledge to create what should have been.

## 📚 Core Lore Documents

### 🪨 [The Komatiite Connection](./komatiite-connection.md)
Why "Koma" and what it means:
- Komatiite geology (ultramafic, ultra-basic)
- The metaphor: ultra-basic rock = ultra-basic computing
- Mantle-direct processing (no unnecessary layers)
- Field locations and geological significance
- Color palette from komatiite geology
- "Ultramafic Computing" philosophy

### 🎨 [Terminal Aesthetics](./terminal-aesthetics.md)
Design philosophy and influences:
- Jurassic Park (1993): "It's a Unix system!"
- Zachtronics games (TIS-100, EXAPUNKS, 20th Century Food Court)
- Industrial minimalism (Dieter Rams, Bauhaus)
- The 3px activity LED
- Why text mode in 2025?
- Color theory: phosphor green, lava orange, deep charcoal

### 🔧 [Retrospec Engineering](./retrospec-engineering.md)
The philosophy behind the fiction:
- What is retrospec engineering?
- The alternate timeline where Koma existed
- Could this have existed? (technology constraints)
- Would experts have built this? (cultural fit)
- Modern knowledge, period constraints
- Why bother? (clarity, learning, aesthetics)

## 🌋 The Geological Theme

Everything connects back to komatiites and geology:

| Component | Geological Origin | Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Koma** | Komatiite (ultramafic volcanic rock) | Ultra-basic = simple but powerful |
| **Olivine** | Primary mineral in komatiites | Stable, foundational, crystallizes first |
| **Spinifex** | Texture of acicular olivine crystals | Graphics built from line patterns |
| **Provenance** | Tracking sediment sources | Tracking tool/package sources |
| **Craton** | Ancient stable continental core | Stable foundation (company name) |
| **Colors** | Olivine green + lava orange + basalt charcoal | Geological palette |

## 🎯 The Retrospec Philosophy

**Retrospec = Retrospective + Specification + Respect**

Koma is retrospec engineering: building technology that:
1. **Could have existed** in 1984-1987 (feasible with period technology)
2. **Should have existed** (solves real problems better)
3. **Respects constraints** (terminal-based, Unix-compatible)
4. **Uses modern knowledge** (clean architecture, good UX)

Not nostalgia. Not limitation. **Improvement through historical lens.**

## 🎮 Influences

- **Jurassic Park (1993)** - Unix workstations are cool
- **Zachtronics games** - Minimalist technical interfaces
- **VT100 terminals** - Green phosphor, functional beauty
- **SGI workstations** - Industrial power tools
- **Unix philosophy** - Text streams, composability, simplicity
- **Dieter Rams** - "Less but better"
- **Geology fieldwork** - Rugged, purposeful tools

## 🌟 Why Lore Matters

Great tools have great stories:
- **Unix** has the Thompson/Ritchie origin, Bell Labs culture
- **Lisp** has McCarthy's mathematical roots, REPL culture
- **Plan 9** has the "what comes after Unix?" vision
- **Emacs** has RMS and the editor wars

**Koma has:**
- The geology connection (authentic domain expertise)
- The retrospec philosophy (thoughtful historical design)
- The ultramafic metaphor (simple-but-powerful)
- The workstation vision (tools for experts, by experts)

Lore isn't decoration. It's **design philosophy made narrative**.

**The Retrospec Truth:**

*Koma Workstation never existed. But it could have. Should have. And now, in a sense, it does - built not in 1984, but in 2025, with the benefit of hindsight and the same foundational principles.*

*Ultramafic computing. From the mantle to the terminal.*
